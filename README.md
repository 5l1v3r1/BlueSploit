# BlueSploit

<p>BlueSploit is the Metasploit of the Blue Team, because I was tired of seing Red Team frameworks, I created Bluesploit. Not many people want to create defensive tools. I get it, Red Team is awesome but is also easy. We need more people creating Blue Team tools and contribute to the defensive side of things.</p><br>

BlueSploit is a DFIR framework that will make it easy for the analyst to kick off an investigation. <br> 
The aim of this framework is to use a set of tools written mostly in PowerShell and make the investigation a breeze. <br>
