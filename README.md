# BlueSploit
BlueSploit is a DFIR framework that will make it easy for the analyst to kick off an investigation. The aim of this framework is to use a set of tools written mostly in PowerShell and make the investigation a breeze.  Current stage of the project: Pre-Alpha  Feel free to contribute! I will try to keep the code clean and easy to read.
